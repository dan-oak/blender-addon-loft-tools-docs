Overview
########

At the core of the add-on, there is a set of Geometry Nodes: regular ones,
and `Tool Nodes`_ (introduced in Blender 4.0). Together with the Python code,
they create a comprehensive modelling system for curve lofting.

.. _Tool Nodes: https://developer.blender.org/docs/release_notes/4.0/geometry_nodes/#node-based-tools

Core Nodes
==========

The core nodes are marked as Assets. By linking the nodes from
``Loft Tools.blend`` into your file, you can use them in custom node
trees.

The Tool nodes together with the add-on's Python part create a powerful
manual modelling system.

They are also marked as Assets and available from a menu in the Curves Edit Mode.
Blender adds the menu automatically reading the hierarchy from the asset library
metadata objects. If you want to move or rename the menu, edit the catalog paths
in the ``Loft Tools.blend``.

Python Components
=================

The Python part of the add-on is focused on improving availability and the
user interface of the core system.

Handles
:::::::

The code adds gizmo-handle for curves created by the nodes. The gizmo edits the
geometry attributes which define handles, similarly to how the built-in handles
work, with some limitations.

Operators
:::::::::

The main add-on's operators call Tool nodes.
They also automatically link the library with the required nodes if not already linked.

Interface
:::::::::

There is a panel and a pie menu with all the available operators in one convenient place.

Asset Library Path
::::::::::::::::::

By enabling the add-on, the code adds the Asset Library automatically into your
File Paths in the Preferences.

Hair Curves Requirement
=======================

We need to use the new (Hair) **Curves** data-block, introduced in 4.0,
instead of the legacy **Curve**. This is required for new Node Tools to be able
to create and edit original geometry attributes, as there is no support for that
in the current regular Curve data-blocks.
