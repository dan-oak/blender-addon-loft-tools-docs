Loft Tools Blender Add-on
#########################

.. warning::

    This is a documentation for an unreleased Blender add-on. To be released soon.

Introduction
============

In 3D modelling, **Lofting** is a method to create smooth surfaces from curve profiles.
You define cross-sections of the desired shape at chosen locations and
a software builds a smooth 3D shape that fit those cross-sections.

This Blender add-on, **Loft Tools**, works with `Curves data-blocks`_ as input cross-sections,
and outputs a `Mesh`_ that that smoothly joins the input cross-sections using `Geometry Nodes`_.

Main Features

- At the core of the add-on, there is Geometry Nodes Modifier.

- A set of basic lofted shapes to start with.

- Pie Menu and Sidebar panel in 3D View with all essential operators.

- Set Loft Curve/Handle Type both on U and V axes.
  The curves that define cross-sections are called **U Curves**,
  and the curves that join them and form the lofted mesh â€” **V Curves**.

- Gizmos for Bezier handles on V axes and Handles Transform operators.

- A single geometry can have separate and independent lofted surfaces. Loft Group operators allow selecting, separating, and merging the surfaces.

- Common Curves utilities have the corresponding Loft variants:

  - Toggle Loft Cyclic operator allows creating loops on both U and V axes.

  - Subdivide Loft Segments operator adds cross-sections naturally along the existing lofted surface.

  - Duplicate in Loft Group. When duplicating a curve, you can control where you add it, before or after the selected curve.

- NURBS surface order, knots mode, and weight parameters can be edited with dedicated operators.
